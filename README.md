## How to play ?

When you see that the game live on Twitch, or others, you can use the tchat to interact with the game. 

For example:  
- 'hello 255 000 000' = join the game with my the Color Red by default
- 'cursor 0.5 0.5 = the next action will be apply at 50%  from left to right on the map and 50% from bot to top.
- 'airdrop 600 =  Deplay 600 troups on the pixel of the cursor
- 'nuke mini" =  request to drop a nuke at the cursor (only apply if you have the fund )  
- ... 

When you want to make serveral in one time, you can do it like this:
- 'cursor 0.1 0.1 > 5000 > fullairdrop > 100000 > cursor 0.7 0.5 > fullairdrop'
